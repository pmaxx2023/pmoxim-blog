      <p>
        I'm a software engineer focused on building developer tools and infrastructure.
        I care about clean code, simple solutions, and shipping things that work.
      </p>

      <h2>What I Do</h2>
      <p>
        Currently, I spend most of my time building tools that make developers more productive.
        I'm particularly interested in CLI design, automation, and making complex systems feel simple.
      </p>

      <h2>Tech I Work With</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Languages:</strong> TypeScript, Go, Rust, Python</li>
        <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> React, Astro, Tailwind CSS</li>
        <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Node.js, PostgreSQL, Redis</li>
        <li><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> Docker, Kubernetes, AWS</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        I believe in starting simple and adding complexity only when needed.
        The best code is often the code you don't write.
        Every abstraction has a cost, and boring technology usually wins.
      </p>

      <h2>Outside of Code</h2>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding, you'll find me reading, exploring new places,
        or tinkering with side projects that may or may not see the light of day.
      </p>
