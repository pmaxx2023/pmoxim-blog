Every abstraction has a cost. Every dependency is a liability. Every layer adds latency—both for your servers and your brain.

## The Complexity Tax

Complex systems demand complex maintenance:

- More documentation to write and keep current
- More edge cases to handle
- More failure modes to debug at 3am
- More onboarding time for new team members

Simple systems pay dividends. They're easier to understand, easier to modify, and easier to delete when requirements change.

## When Simple Beats Smart

I once inherited a "microservices" architecture with 12 services for an app that served 100 users. The clever distributed system was replaced with a single SQLite database and a 500-line Python script.

Deployment went from a 45-minute orchestrated rollout to `scp` and `systemctl restart`.

## How to Stay Simple

1. **Start with a monolith** — Split when you feel the pain, not before
2. **Use boring technology** — Postgres, Redis, and nginx solve most problems
3. **Question every dependency** — Can you write those 50 lines yourself?
4. **Delete aggressively** — Features you remove can't have bugs

## The Right Amount of Complexity

The goal isn't zero complexity. Some problems are genuinely complex and deserve sophisticated solutions.

The goal is *appropriate* complexity. Use the simplest solution that actually solves the problem. Nothing more.
