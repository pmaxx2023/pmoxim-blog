You bite into a cookie expecting raisins because the last one had them. But this cookie doesn't. Your brain still tastes them anyway—ghost raisins.

This happens constantly in product development.

## The Pattern

You remove a feature, deprecate a workflow, or change a default. Users who experienced the old version keep expecting it. They click where the button used to be. They look for the setting that's gone. They file bugs about "missing" functionality that was intentionally removed.

The feature is gone, but its ghost lingers.

## Why This Matters

Ghost raisins aren't just user confusion—they're a signal about how habits form around your product. Every feature you ship creates an expectation. Every workflow becomes muscle memory. Every default becomes "how it works."

When you change these things, you're not just updating code. You're fighting against ingrained behavior.

I've watched users struggle with "improved" interfaces that moved three buttons. The new layout was objectively better—cleaner, more logical, faster. Didn't matter. Their hands knew where the old buttons lived. The ghost buttons were still there for them.

## What To Do About It

**1. Deprecate loudly before removing quietly.**

If something's going away, warn people. Give them time to adjust. "This feature will be removed in 30 days" hurts less than "Where did it go?"

**2. Leave breadcrumbs.**

When users click where the old thing was, tell them where it moved. A tooltip that says "Looking for X? It's now in Settings > Advanced" costs you nothing and saves them frustration.

**3. Question every removal.**

Before you delete something, ask: how many people have this in muscle memory? If it's a lot, the "cleanup" might cost more than the clutter.

**4. Watch the support tickets.**

After any removal, track what people ask about. Ghost raisins show up in support queues before they show up in metrics.

## The Deeper Lesson

Products accumulate expectations like sediment. Each release deposits another layer of "how things work" into your users' brains. You can't see this sediment, but it's load-bearing.

Redesigns fail when they ignore the sediment. You're not starting fresh—you're excavating.

The next time you're about to remove something "nobody uses," check the sediment. Those ghost raisins might be holding up more than you think.
