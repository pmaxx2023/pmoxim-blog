Clean code isn't about following rules. It's about empathy for the next person who reads it—often yourself, six months later, wondering what you were thinking.

## Names Matter More Than You Think

A well-named function eliminates the need for a comment. Compare:

```typescript
// Bad
function proc(d: Data[]) { ... }

// Good
function filterExpiredSubscriptions(subscriptions: Subscription[]) { ... }
```

The second version tells you exactly what it does. No mental overhead required.

## Functions Should Do One Thing

If you're using "and" to describe what a function does, it's doing too much.

```typescript
// Doing too much
function validateAndSaveUser(user: User) { ... }

// Better
function validateUser(user: User): ValidationResult { ... }
function saveUser(user: User): Promise<User> { ... }
```

Smaller functions are easier to test, easier to reuse, and easier to understand.

## Comments Are a Last Resort

Comments should explain *why*, not *what*. The code already tells you what it does—if it doesn't, the code needs work.

```typescript
// Bad comment
// Increment counter by 1
counter++;

// Good comment
// Rate limiting: prevent more than 100 requests per minute
if (requestCount > 100) return;
```

## Delete Dead Code

Commented-out code is dead code. Delete it. Git remembers everything.

Your codebase should contain only code that runs. Everything else is noise.
