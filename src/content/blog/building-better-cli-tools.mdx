Good CLI tools feel invisible. They do exactly what you expect, fail gracefully when things go wrong, and never make you reach for the documentation.

## The Essentials

Every CLI tool should nail these fundamentals:

1. **Clear error messages** - Tell users what went wrong and how to fix it
2. **Helpful defaults** - The common case should require zero configuration
3. **Escape hatches** - Let power users override everything

## Output Matters

Your CLI's output is its user interface. Treat it with the same care you'd give a web app.

```bash
# Bad: walls of text
Processing file... done
Processing file... done
Processing file... done
Error: Something failed

# Good: clear progress and context
[1/3] Processing config.json... done
[2/3] Processing data.json... done
[3/3] Processing schema.json... failed

Error: Invalid JSON in schema.json (line 42)
  Expected "}" but found ","
```

## The Exit Code Contract

Exit codes aren't just for scripts—they're a promise to your users:

- `0` - Everything worked
- `1` - General error
- `2` - Invalid usage

Honor this contract, and your tool will play nicely with others.

## Ship Something

The best CLI tool is the one that exists. Start simple, ship it, and iterate based on real feedback.
