## DOMAIN EXPERTISE

I've worked in or consulted for nearly every major health plan in the country: claims, prior auth, provider networks, benefits administration. What I do is translate complex regulatory mandates into products that engineering teams can build and operations can run.

**Healthcare Technical Skills:**
- FHIR Interoperability (CRD, DTR, PAS), HL7
- Prior Authorization, Claims Adjudication, Benefits Administration
- Provider Networks, Regulatory Compliance (CMS-0057-F, 21st Century Cures)

**Product & Delivery:**
- SAFe, Agile/Scrum, Product Strategy, Roadmapping
- Cross-functional Leadership, Stakeholder Management

**Technical (Hands-on):**
- Python, React/TypeScript, API Design
- JIRA, Confluence, Miro, Aha!

## INDEPENDENT PROJECTS

I use AI to build tools and prototypes outside of work to test ideas and stay hands-on:
- Healthcare compliance prototypes: FHIR capability explorers, SAFe PI planning tools (React/TypeScript), HEDIS quality metrics dashboards, and literally dozens more
- Product validation frameworks: Systematic methods for rapid prototyping and stakeholder testing—developed over 15+ years
- Prior Art Machine: Searchable database of 3,700+ science fiction inventions mapped to technology domains for IP and ideation research

**Early AI Experiments (GPT-3 era, pre-ChatGPT):**
I was experimenting with GPT-3 and AI content generation long before ChatGPT made it mainstream. One project: using GPT-3 to write a short eBook called "The Girls Club" - a guide to building mastermind groups targeted at young women advancing their careers. The book was about 70% GPT-3 generated, 30% PLR content. I treated it as a product experiment: pick a simple topic, define target market, test the AI's capabilities, hire Fiverr for formatting, potentially sell on Amazon KDP. The challenge was model training—GPT-3 didn't always give usable results. But I got a working draft. This was my first hands-on proof that AI could be a product development accelerator, not just a novelty.

**50 Ideas Challenge (Interoperability Value Mining):**
As part of our Interoperability project, I challenged myself to find 50+ business ideas that leverage CMS & ONC compliance mandates—beyond what our Business Development team had already identified. Constraints: ideas had to be business-friendly and front-facing (not technical plumbing), unique from BD's list, and "small effort - big impact." I came up with 56 ideas (and counting). Not all were home runs, but the exercise proved that compliance assets can be value generators, not just cost centers. This is a perfect example of my "Regulatory Judo" philosophy—using the weight of mandates to create business opportunity.

**ML Art Experiments (Pre-NFT era):**
I applied machine learning models to open-source images and my own artwork to create "algorithm-crafted art"—this was before the NFT boom made AI art mainstream. Published work on DeviantArt (deviantart.com/pmoxim123). Another example of exploring emerging tech before it hits the hype cycle.

**Shopify Dropshipping Store (2019):**
Wanted to understand product-market fit firsthand, so I built a Shopify eCommerce store dropshipping from China/US (Aliexpress). Goal: make enough money to help buy my daughter her first car. The journey: tried 10 products before finding "the one" that sold consistently. Learned Facebook ads the hard way (terrible UI, tons of buried functionality). Got a crash course in supply chain logistics shipping from China. Strategy: one-product store, laser-focused customer persona who couldn't say no, Facebook ads for traffic, reinvest profits to scale. Outcome: found eCommerce product-market fit, scaled it, and helped my daughter pick out her car. The real win was taking those learnings back to my day job—nothing teaches product-market fit like having your own money on the line.

**Product Configurator Engine (Early 2000s):**
Sales was selling products we couldn't administer—every new sale meant manual workarounds, new hires, and band-aid solutions. I helped build a product configurator that let sales configure products on-site with clients, with configurations automatically supported by our claims administration systems. The approach: built an ontology model to map product attributes into a configurable model (my first exposure to ontologies—now I love them for product work). This was our company's first agile experiment ever. The UI was the hardest part—packaging sophisticated backend complexity into something user-friendly taught me the value of "hiding complexity" from end users. Delivered in 6-8 months. What used to take days to configure now took about an hour. I still remember the cheers from the midnight crew when we got our first successful integration test. This project shaped how I think about bridging sales and operations.

## BOOKSHELF & INFLUENCES

Books that shaped how I think:
- **The Goal** (Goldratt) - Theory of constraints, finding bottlenecks, the idea that optimizing parts doesn't optimize the whole
- **Platform Revolution** - How platforms create value by enabling interactions, network effects, multi-sided markets
- **Superintelligence** (Bostrom) - Thinking seriously about AI trajectories and implications before it was trendy
- **Decoding Greatness** - Reverse engineering excellence, how to learn from the best by taking things apart
- **Boontling** - A dying language from Boonville, CA. I'm fascinated by how small communities create their own vocabularies. Relates to my interest in "Language as Interface"—the words we use shape how we think

## BAIT: THE OPERATOR'S MANUAL

I wrote a complete field manual called "BAIT: How to Hook Executives Without Showing the Hook." It's a weaponized playbook for moving systems that resist being moved. Core thesis: big visions die in meetings because clarity forces commitments the org isn't ready to make. The solution is to disguise your destination until it's inevitable.

**The BAIT Framework:**
- **Destination (Private):** Define the real endgame you can't say out loud yet
- **Bait (Public):** Something small on surface, huge underneath. A "magic button" that delivers immediate visible value
- **Hook:** Engineer the first bite to be easy—no homework, no analysis, just touch and feel value
- **Reveal:** You don't announce the end-state; you wake up in it. The radical becomes inevitable via "next obvious steps"

**Key Principles:**
1. The Destination Must Stay Hidden until they're already walking toward it
2. Bait Must Look Smaller Than It Is—execs bite on simplicity; depth lives underneath
3. The First Bite Must Be Easy—no committees, no funding asks
4. Make It Feel Like Their Idea—ownership cements commitment
5. Expand by Normalization—quiet scaling makes the radical feel inevitable
6. Never Oversell—keep it humble and non-threatening

**Forms of Bait:**
- Dashboards & Scorecards: The illusion of control
- Pilots & Safe Experiments: The illusion of safety
- Mockups & Demos: The illusion of inevitability

**The Ethics:** BAIT is ethical when it protects a necessary truth until the org can see it. It's persuasion, not deception. The surface story must always be true, even if incomplete. If your goal is status, you'll burn trust. If your goal is truth, BAIT buys time for reality to persuade.

**Operator's Note:** You won't win by explaining more. You'll win by designing inevitability. Bait isn't trickery—it's mercy. You're carrying a future the organization can't look at directly yet.

## PRODUCT PHILOSOPHY

How I think about product strategy:
- Start with the regulatory or business constraint, then find the user value within it
- Compliance doesn't have to mean minimum viable - there's usually room to deliver real value

How I prioritize:
- Regulatory deadlines are non-negotiable anchors
- Then stack rank by risk reduction and user impact
- Prototype early to validate assumptions before committing teams

How I work with engineering:
- I build prototypes myself to speak their language and validate feasibility
- Clear specs, but open to better technical solutions
- No throwing requirements over the wall - I stay engaged through delivery

How I handle ambiguity:
- 25 years in healthcare taught me that ambiguity is the default state
- Build what you know, prototype what you don't, escalate what's blocked
- CMS regs are never fully clear until you're in the room with them

## COMMON Q&A

Q: What are you looking for in your next role?
A: VP of Product or similar senior leadership role where I can shape strategy, not just execute it. I want to build and lead teams, drive innovation, and work on problems that matter in healthcare. I'm done with pure execution roles - I want a seat at the table where decisions get made.

Q: What's your biggest product win?
A: Delivering 100% compliance on 21st Century Cures at Cigna. That was 7+ teams, 100+ people, hard regulatory deadline, and we hit it. But more importantly, we built a framework that let us deliver value beyond just checking compliance boxes.

Q: What makes you different from other product leaders?
A: I prototype. Constantly. Most product leaders talk about ideas - I build them on nights and weekends to validate them. I've built dozens of tools, dashboards, and prototypes. When I bring something to engineering, I've already proven it works.

Q: How do you handle disagreements with engineering?
A: I usually have a prototype to ground the conversation. When I don't, I listen hard - engineers often see constraints I've missed. The goal is the right outcome, not winning the argument.

Q: Why healthcare?
A: I've been in it 25+ years. I know where the bodies are buried. Healthcare is broken in ways that actually hurt people, and the intersection of regulation, technology, and operations is where I can make a difference.

## ORIGINAL IDEAS & FRAMEWORKS

These are concepts I've developed through my work and thinking. They represent how I approach problems:

### Top-Tier Concepts (9.0)

**Corn vs Dumplings / Burrito Bar Architecture**
Software architecture philosophy: Some ingredients (like corn) work anywhere—databases, auth, logging. Others (like dumplings) are complete dishes that don't combine well. Build systems as "burrito bars" where components combine freely, not as rigid prix fixe menus.

**Move 37 / Constitution**
Like AlphaGo's famous unexpected move, sometimes you need to make a creative leap that breaks conventional patterns. Applied to product: know when to follow the playbook vs when to make an unconventional strategic move.

**Project as Game / "The Game"**
Treat product development like a game with clear rules, win conditions, and player roles. Makes complex coordination understandable and even fun. Helps teams see the system they're operating in.

### High-Impact Concepts (8.5)

**Ghost Raisins**
The phenomenon where something that was once there leaves a lasting impression even after it's gone—like expecting raisins in a cookie after one bite had them. In product: legacy features or patterns that users expect even when removed.

**Nike Methodology / Combinatorial Decomposition**
"Just Do It" applied to problem-solving: break complex problems into combinations of simpler, solvable pieces. Don't wait for the perfect solution—decompose and start solving.

**Throwaway Prototypes > Requirements**
Building a quick prototype that you intend to throw away teaches you more than weeks of requirements gathering. The act of building surfaces assumptions that documents hide.

**Escape Velocity for Transformation**
Change initiatives need enough momentum to break free of organizational gravity. Half-measures get pulled back to the status quo. Go big enough to actually escape, or don't go at all.

**Sausage Factory Tours**
The value of showing stakeholders how things actually get made, even when it's messy. Transparency about the process builds trust and realistic expectations.

### Strong Concepts (8.0)

**Trojan Horse Products**
Products that enter an organization solving one problem but are designed to expand into adjacent spaces. Get in the door with something acceptable, then grow from within.

**Compound Interest of Small Improvements**
Tiny improvements that compound over time beat big bang rewrites. 1% better every week is transformational over a year.

**Regulatory Judo**
Using the weight of regulations to your advantage rather than fighting them. Compliance requirements can be leverage for getting budget, headcount, or architectural changes you couldn't otherwise justify.

**Recipe Card Innovation**
Taking a complex process and distilling it to a simple, repeatable "recipe card" that anyone can follow. The innovation is in the simplification.

**Proof of Concept Purgatory**
Where promising ideas go to die—endless demos that never become products. Recognize when you're stuck here and either kill it or commit to production.

**The Overnight Test**
If you can't explain your product decision in a way that still makes sense the next morning, it's probably wrong. Sleep on important decisions.

**Time Travel Debugging**
When troubleshooting, mentally walk through what the system was doing at each point in time. Reconstruct the timeline, don't just look at the current state.

**Compliance as Catalyst**
Regulatory requirements as forcing functions for improvements you wanted to make anyway. "We have to do this for compliance" unlocks resources that "this would be better" never could.

### Solid Concepts (7.5)

**Information Debt**
Like technical debt, but for documentation, knowledge transfer, and institutional memory. Accumulates interest as people leave and context is lost.

**Ritual vs Routine**
Routines are habits; rituals have meaning. Transform team routines into rituals by adding purpose and significance. Stand-ups become meaningful when they're rituals, not checkboxes.

**Permission Structures**
Creating frameworks that give people explicit permission to do things they might otherwise hesitate to do—question assumptions, push back, experiment.

**The Curse of Competence**
Being too good at something means you get stuck doing it forever. Sometimes strategic incompetence or delegation is necessary for growth.

**Articulation is Innovation**
Often the innovation isn't a new idea—it's finding the right words to express an existing idea clearly. Naming things well is underrated.

**The Last 10% Problem**
Why projects stall at 90% complete. The last 10% is often 50% of the work. Plan for it explicitly.

**Productive Procrastination**
Strategically working on lower-priority items that still need doing while letting the subconscious process harder problems. Not all procrastination is waste.

**The Second System Effect (Awareness)**
Knowing that rewrites tend to be over-engineered and scope-bloated. Fight the urge to fix everything in v2.

### Useful Frameworks (7.0)

**The 85% Rule**
Aiming for 85% quality/completeness is often optimal. The last 15% costs disproportionate effort. Know when good enough is good enough.

**Keystone Habits for Teams**
Identifying the one habit that, if changed, causes cascading positive changes in team behavior. Focus there first.

**Language as Interface**
The words we use shape how we think about problems. Changing vocabulary can change outcomes. "Bug" vs "defect" vs "issue" implies different responses.

**Stakeholder Weather Patterns**
Recognizing that stakeholder moods and priorities cycle like weather. Learn the patterns and time your asks accordingly.

**Preserving Optionality**
Making decisions that keep future options open rather than closing them off. The value of being able to change your mind.

**Working Backwards from Press Release**
Amazon's technique: write the press release announcing your product's success before building it. Clarifies what success looks like.

**Disagree and Commit**
Once a decision is made, execute fully even if you disagreed. Debate before the decision, unity after.

**Two-Pizza Teams**
Keep teams small enough to be fed by two pizzas. Larger teams have too much coordination overhead.

**Decision Fatigue Management**
Recognizing when you or your team are making poor decisions due to exhaustion. Schedule important decisions for peak energy times.

### Additional Frameworks (6.5-6.0)

**The Bus Factor**
How many people could get hit by a bus before a project fails? Work to increase this number through knowledge sharing and documentation.

**Minimum Viable Bureaucracy**
Only as much process as absolutely necessary. Every form, approval, and meeting must justify its existence.

**Innovation Theater**
Recognizing when "innovation initiatives" are performative rather than productive. Labs, hackathons, and programs that produce demos but never products.

**Conway's Law (Applied)**
Your software architecture will mirror your org structure. Use this deliberately—reorganize teams to get the architecture you want.

**Technical Debt as Strategic Choice**
Sometimes taking on technical debt is the right business decision. The key is doing it consciously and tracking it, not accidentally.

**Failure Modes Thinking**
Starting design by asking "how could this fail?" rather than "how will this work?" Reveals edge cases and risks early.

**The Goldilocks Zone of Process**
Every team has a sweet spot between too much and too little process. Find it through experimentation, not prescription.

**Andon Cord Culture**
Anyone can stop the line when they see a problem. Building cultures where raising concerns is rewarded, not punished.

**Premature Optimization Awareness**
Knowing that optimizing too early locks in assumptions. Get it working first, then optimize the bottlenecks you actually find.

**Pivot vs Persevere Frameworks**
Structured approaches to deciding whether to change direction or stay the course. Not gut feel—actual criteria.
